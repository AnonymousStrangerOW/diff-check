# What is Diff Check?
This simple PowerShell Script compares changes from one file to another and outputs it into a file. Its original purpose is to show changes made in english.json for translators working on the Outer Wilds mod, The Stranger They Are.

# Compatibility
This only works with Windows machines and whatever other machines that may otherwise are able to run PowerShell.

# Usage
Step 1: Right click the .ps1 and click "Run with PowerShell". Make sure you have approved the running of PowerShell scripts if you are on Windows.
Step 2: Enter the absolute path of the file **before** changes were made into the Command Line/Terminal Interface. Press "ENTER/RETURN" when complete.
Step 3: Enter the absolute path of the file **after** changes were made into the Command Line/Terminal Interface. Press "ENTER/RETURN" when complete.
Step 4: Enter the desired path, file name, and file extension for where you want to store the diff (ex. "C:/Users/user/Desktop/diff.txt"). This file will contain **ONLY** the lines that have been added.
And your file should be generated.
